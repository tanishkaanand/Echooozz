                    Ahoy! Have you seen the movie Pirates of the Caribbean? I got the idea to play the piano on the pirates theme from my little sister. I myself have never seen the series. For the first time when I heard this theme song, it felt like a very power-driven song. You feel it in your veins when the song, the beat begins, so I thought of playing it with my musical touch. It was a bit difficult for me to play this song as along with the piano, a strong powerful rhythm was needed, for that I played the background beats on virtual drums and then merged both of the sounds together. I myself was enjoying the BGM, but didnâ€™t know that the audience would have loved it that much and it came to be a huge hit on the channel.
A very mischievous pirate taking the world by storm!
