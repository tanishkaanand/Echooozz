                    People like different kinds of music for many reasons, even depending on their mood.
                    But it brings people together, whether through the same taste in music or the willingness to try
                    something new or even perform music with others. Being a part of concerts, orchestra bands, or any kind of group,
                    brings people closer to one another. Music is the fountain of sentiments, energy & love. The philosophy of human life,
                    the eternal prayers of the soul, and the singing in praise of the human spirit are merged in music. From saints down to
                    people of the modern age, all great sages took the help of music to captivate the general public or to release the
                    pent-up feeling in their own minds.</p>
